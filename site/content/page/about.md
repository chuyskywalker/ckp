Thanks for dropping by, let me tell you about myself!

## Artistic vision

My over-arching vision is to create beauty in all aspects of life. 

My clothing designs are how I express myself; they offer me a way to communicate when words can’t. I like to create things that make me happy, things that I can’t find in stores, and clothes that make other people happy. 

I find inspiration in Korean culture and K-dramas as well as European history, especially Marie Antoinette and Madame de Pompadour. When I’m designing something, I often ask myself, “If Marie Antoinette were alive now, would she wear this?” A design could be based on a silly sentence, a stimulating conversation, a museum exhibit, a movie. Life itself is inspiring. My designs represent secret inner desires. Many of them hold secrets inside, like a delicate wisp of lace hidden under a skirt.

I like to put humor in my clothes. I meditate on my designs before I start to draw or sew and I think about positive things.
